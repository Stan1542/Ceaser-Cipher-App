# Caesar Cipher App

## Overview
This repository contains a web application developed as part of an assignment for the Information Security module. The main focus of the assignment was to implement the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm using JavaScript.

## Description
The Caesar Cipher, named after Julius Caesar, is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions up or down the alphabet. Despite its simplicity and vulnerability to modern cryptographic attacks, it serves as an educational tool for teaching encryption concepts.

## Features
- Encryption: The web application allows users to encrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Decryption: Users can also decrypt messages that were previously encrypted using the same algorithm.
- JavaScript Implementation: The encryption and decryption functionalities are implemented using JavaScript, making the application interactive and dynamic.

## Learning Objectives
- Understanding Encryption Techniques: Through implementing the Caesar Cipher algorithm, students gain insights into basic encryption techniques and their applications.
- JavaScript Programming: Developing the encryption and decryption functionalities using JavaScript enhances students' programming skills.
- Information Security Concepts: Exploring encryption algorithms contributes to a deeper understanding of information security concepts and practices.

## Usage
To use the Caesar Cipher web application:
1. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
2. Enter a message to encrypt or decrypt in the input field.
3. Choose the appropriate action (encrypt or decrypt) and provide the required parameters.
4. Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to perform the selected action.
5. View the result in the output field.
